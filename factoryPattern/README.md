## Pet Clinic Project
**Problem:**
Implement factory design pattern using Pet as the factory interface.  The interface implements two methods: makeSound() and play().

Dog and Cat are concrete objects that implements Pet interface.

PetRecord holds attributes such as petId, petName, and Pet.

Clinic would be the client object.
