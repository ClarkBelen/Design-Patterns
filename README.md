# Design Patterns in JAVA
## Creational Design Patterns
1. [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/factoryPattern) - provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
2. [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/singletonPattern) - ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
   
## Structural Design Patterns
1. [Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/adapterPattern) - allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
2. [Facade Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/facadePattern) - provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
3. [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/decoratorPattern) - allows the behavior of an object to be extended dynamically, without the need to change its source code. 

## Behavioral Design Patterns
1. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/commandPattern) - encapsulating all the data related to command in one object
2. [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/ClarkBelen/observerPattern) - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
